    "text": "I was initiated into the world of Hindustani classical music at the age of 6. After initial training under Shri Anant Heggar Hegde, I was fortunate to receive vocal training and early inspiration from the late sarod maestro Pt. Rajeev Taranath. When I was 11, Pandit ji moved cities and entrusted me to Vidushi Lalith J. Rao, doyenne of the Agra-Atrauli gharana. Over the last 17 years, under Lalith ji’s caring, encouraging and astute guidance, I have continued my journey in music, exploring the vastness and intricacies of the Agra-Atrauli tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteListen Now\n\n\n\nCheck out my latest tracks on SoundCloud or watch performances on YouTube."

This chemical language is essential for understanding their functional roles and ecological dynamics.\nI utilize a 3D printed platform and high-throughput mass spectrometry to eavesdrop on interactions between pairs of bacterial strains.
