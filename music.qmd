# My Musical Journey

I was initiated into the world of Hindustani classical music at the age of 6. After initial training under Shri Anant Heggar Hegde, I was fortunate to receive vocal training and early inspiration from the late sarod maestro Pt. Rajeev Taranath. When I was 11, Pandit ji moved cities and entrusted me to Vidushi Lalith J. Rao, doyenne of the Agra-Atrauli gharana. Over the last 17 years, under Lalith ji's caring, encouraging and astute guidance, I have continued my journey in music, exploring the vastness and intricacies of the Agra-Atrauli tradition.
