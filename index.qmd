## Scientist. Musician. Dancer.

I am a PhD student in **Computational Biology**, currently based in [City/University]. My research lives at the intersection of microbial genomics and high-throughput data analysis, where I work on decoding the chemical conversations of soil bacteria.

Beyond the lab, my life is defined by the rhythms of Indian classical arts. As a **Hindustani Classical Musician** and **Kathak Dancer**, I find that the precision of a *Raag* or the mathematical complexity of a *Taal* mirrors the structured logic of the biological systems I study.

### What I'm working on:
* **Research:** Deciphering mass spectrometry data for microbial interactions.
* **Music:** Exploring the depth of [Your Specific Raag interests].
* **Life:** Training for my next race and experimenting with low-carb sourdough.
