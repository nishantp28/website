## Scientist. Musician. Dancer.

I am a PhD student in **Integrative Systems Biology** at the **University of Pittsburgh**. My research lives at the intersection of microbiology, genomics and high-throughput data analysis, where I work on decrypting the chemical interactions between soil bacteria.

Beyond the lab, my life is defined by the the Indian classical arts. I am a trained **Hindustani Classical Musician** and **Kathak Dancer**, and I believe that the boundaries between disciplines are fading—whether in science or art.

### What I'm working on:
* **Research:** Deciphering patterns in mass spectrometry data indicative of microbial interactions.
* **Music & Dance:** Exploring the intricacies of India's ancient traditions and their modern-day relevance.
* **Hobbies:** Cooking, running, meditating, and spending time on the beach.
